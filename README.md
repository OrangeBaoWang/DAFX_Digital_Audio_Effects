The aim of this project is to design a “Digital audio effects” black box (as an
acronym we use DAFX), which takes input audio signal, modify input signal
characteristic by some control parameters to create desired effect and deliver output
signal. The input and output audio signals are monitored by acoustical and visual
representation of the signal. These DAFX s’ can be realised by implementing
suitable digital filters whose response can be controlled.

In short following are the goal of this project
 Classification and definition of audio effects.
 Design algorithm/filters which can create these effects on Audio signals.
 Study the change in response by changing control parameters.
 Provide graphical control panel for controlling filter parameters.
 Provide acoustical and visual representation of input and output audio signals.
